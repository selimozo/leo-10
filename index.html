            In the 2004/05 season, Lionel Messi made his debut for FC
            Barcelona's first team, marking the beginning of an extraordinary
            career. At just 17 years old, Messi appeared in his first official
            match on October 16, 2004, against Espanyol, becoming the youngest
            player to represent Barcelona in an official competition at that
            time.
            <span class="br"></span>He scored his first senior goal on May 1,
            2005, against Albacete, which made him the youngest goal scorer in
            the club's history at that point. This goal, assisted by Ronaldinho,
            was a glimpse of the chemistry that would develop between the two
            and foreshadowed Messi’s future greatness. Throughout the season,
            Messi trained regularly with the first team, gaining valuable
            experience and adapting to the high level of competition in La Liga.
            <span class="br"></span>Barcelona, under Frank Rijkaard, won the La
            Liga title that year, with Messi contributing to the team’s success

            football.

            pace and skill, drawing numerous fouls, including the one that led
            to Asier del Horno’s red card. His influence on the game was
            undeniable, and his performance marked him as a rising star on the
