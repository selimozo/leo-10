            In the 2004/05 season, Lionel Messi made his debut for FC
            Barcelona's first team, marking the beginning of an extraordinary
            career. At just 17 years old, Messi appeared in his first official
            match on October 16, 2004, against Espanyol, becoming the youngest
            player to represent Barcelona in an official competition at that
            time.
            <span class="br"></span>He scored his first senior goal on May 1,
            2005, against Albacete, which made him the youngest goal scorer in
            the club's history at that point. This goal, assisted by Ronaldinho,
            was a glimpse of the chemistry that would develop between the two
            and foreshadowed Messi’s future greatness. Throughout the season,
            Messi trained regularly with the first team, gaining valuable
            experience and adapting to the high level of competition in La Liga.

            match, Messi's hat-trick making him the all-time top scorer in El
            Clásico history at that point, surpassing Alfredo Di Stéfano.
            Despite Messi's brilliance, Barcelona had a tough season, finishing
            second in La Liga, getting eliminated by Atlético Madrid in the
            Champions League quarterfinals, and losing the Copa del Rey final to
            Real Madrid. This season was marked by Messi's individual brilliance
            but also by the team's struggle to secure major trophies.<span

            the final in Brazil. Messi was instrumental throughout the
            tournament, scoring crucial goals and assists, but Argentina
            narrowly lost 1-0 to Germany in the final. Despite the defeat, Messi
            was awarded the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player.

            The 2014/15 season was a historic one for Lionel Messi and FC
            Barcelona, marked by the incredible success of the "MSN" trio—Messi,
            Luis Suárez, and Neymar—who combined to score an astonishing 122
            goals across all competitions. Messi was instrumental in leading
            Barcelona to a treble, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey, and UEFA
            Champions League. One of the most iconic moments of the season came
            in Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao. Messi scored an
            extraordinary solo goal, dribbling past several defenders from the
            right wing before finishing with a powerful strike. The commentator
            famously exclaimed, "Can he go all the way!" as Messi's brilliance
            left everyone in awe. This goal is often regarded as one of the best
            of his career.<span class="br"></span>Another unforgettable moment
            was in the Champions League semifinals against Bayern Munich. In the
            first leg at the Camp Nou, Messi scored twice, with his second goal
            becoming legendary. He dribbled past Jerome Boateng, causing the
            defender to lose his balance and fall, before calmly chipping the
            ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. This moment was widely celebrated
            and became a defining highlight of Messi’s career. In the Champions
            League, Barcelona defeated Juventus 3-1 to win the title. Messi's
            performances throughout the tournament also saw him become the joint
            top scorer of UEFA Champions League for the season. The 2014/15
            season was filled with iconic moments for Messi, from his
            partnership with Suárez and Neymar to his brilliant individual
            displays, making it one of the most memorable campaigns of his
            illustrious career.

            The 2015/16 season was another remarkable year for Lionel Messi and
            FC Barcelona, building on the success of their treble-winning
            campaign the previous season. Messi continued to play a central role
            in Barcelona's dominance, leading the team to several major
            victories to his already impressive collection. Messi, alongside
            Suarez and Neymar, formed the lethal "MSN" attacking trio, which
            terrorized defenses across Europe. The trio scored a combined total
            of 131 goals in all competitions, surpassing their own record from
            the previous season.<span class="br"></span>One of the standout
            moments of the season was Messi's performance in the UEFA Super Cup
            against Sevilla. Barcelona won 5-4 in a thrilling match, with Messi
            scoring two stunning free-kick goals to help secure the trophy. His
            ability to deliver in crucial moments was once again on full
            display. In La Liga, Messi was instrumental in Barcelona’s title
            defense, contributing with key goals and assists. One memorable
            moment came in a win over Celta Vigo, where Messi assisted Luis
            Suárez with an ingenious pass from a penalty kick, a move that drew
            widespread admiration for its creativity. Messi also played a
            pivotal role in Barcelona's journey to the Copa del Rey final, where
            they faced Sevilla. In a tense and hard-fought match, Barcelona
            emerged victorious with a 2-0 win after extra time, securing the
            domestic double.<span class="br"></span>Although Barcelona fell
            short in Champions League quarterfinals, Messi’s overall
            contribution to the season was immense. In addition to his club
            games, Messi also leading the national team to the Copa America
            final. Though Argentina were runners-up after losing to Chile on
            penalties, Messi was named the tournament's top assist provider.

            didn’t clinch the La Liga or Champions League titles, Messi
            delivered some of the most iconic and emotionally charged moments of

            rising in the biggest moments.<span class="br"></span>One of the
            most historic games came in the Champions League Round of 16 against

            returned to the Camp Nou with a mountain to climb. In what is now
            remembered as "La Remontada", Messi and his teammates pulled off the
            greatest comeback in Champions League history, winning 6-1 in the
            second leg. Messi scored the third goal from the penalty spot,
            reigniting hope and belief. Neymar and Sergi Roberto finished off
            the miracle. The image of Leo and the team celebrating passionately

            In a must-win game against Real Madrid, the score was tied 2-2
            heading into stoppage time. Then, in the 92nd minute, Messi scored a
            stunning winner, finishing off a team move with his trademark
            composure. After the goal, he held up his No. 10 shirt to the
            stunned Madrid crowd—an image that instantly became symbolic of his
            dominance. That goal wasn’t just a winner in El Clásico—it was also
            his 500th goal for Barcelona, making the moment even more
            historic.<span class="br"></span> Messi also helped Barcelona lift
            silverware that season. At the very start of the campaign, they won
            the Spanish Super Cup, defeating Sevilla 5-0 on aggregate. Messi
            scored in the second leg and was heavily involved across both
            matches. Later in the season, Barcelona claimed the Copa del Rey
            title, beating 3-1 in the final. Messi opened the scoring and
            provided an assist, underlining his consistent influence on the big
            stage.<span class="br"></span>Though the season didn’t bring a

            The 2017/18 season was yet anothermagic moments and silverware.
            Though Barcelona missed out on Champions League glory, Messi’s
            brilliance was on full display across all competitions, as he led
            the team to a domestic double and continued to break records with
            ease. <span class="br"></span>Before the club season even began,
            Messi had already delivered one of the most iconic performances of
            his international career. In October 2017, Argentina faced Ecuador
            in their final World Cup qualifier. Argentina were at risk of
            missing the 2018 World Cup. After conceding an early goal, the
            pressure was immense. But Messi stepped up in legendary fashion,
            scoring a hat-trick to complete the comeback and secure Argentina’s
            ticket to World Cup. His second goal, a rocket into the top corner,
            and his third, a calm chip over the keeper, were reminders that
            Messi thrives in the biggest moments. That night, he didn’t just win
            a football match—he saved a nation’s World Cup hopes.<span
              class="br"
            ></span
            >At club level, Messi picked up right where he left off. One of the
            season’s standout moments came in the Champions League Round of 16
            against Chelsea. After a goalless draw in the first leg at Stamford
            Bridge, the pressure was on in the return leg at the Camp Nou. Messi
            rose to the occasion, scoring twice and assisting once, dismantling
            Chelsea almost single-handedly. His first goal came just over two
            minutes in—Barcelona’s fastest ever in a Champions League match.
            Over the two legs, he ended a long-standing drought against Chelsea
            and proved once again he was built for the biggest nights. Earlier
            in the group stage, Messi also shined against Juventus and Gianluigi
            Buffon, scoring a brilliant brace in a 3-0 win and leading Barça to
            top their group unbeaten.<span class="br"></span> On the domestic
            front, Messi was unstoppable. He finished as the top scorer in La
            Liga with 34 goals, playing a vital role in helping Barcelona go
            unbeaten for 36 games and clinch the league title with style. His
            performances in key games, including late winners, free-kick
            stunners, and brilliant assists, showcased his dominance in Spain
            yet again. FC Barcelona lost only one game in La Liga that season —
            and Messi wasn't even in the squad for that match.<span
              class="br"
            ></span
            >In the Copa del Rey, Messi was at the heart of another title run.
            In the final against Sevilla, Barcelona delivered a footballing
            exhibition, winning 5-0 in one of the most one-sided finals in
            memory. On the world stage, he also starred in the 2018 World Cup
            group stage, especially in the must-win match against Nigeria. Under
            intense pressure, Messi opened the scoring with a stunning
            goal—taking down a long ball in full stride and finishing with his
            weaker foot. It was a moment of magic that helped Argentina to
            advance.

            The 2018/19 season was a year where Lionel Messi delivered some of
            the finest football of his career. Named club captain after
            Iniesta’s departure, Messi embraced the responsibility and put
            Barcelona on his back, leading them through a season filled with
            breathtaking performances, unforgettable goals, and dominant
            displays. Although the UCL campaign ended in heartbreak, Messi’s
            individual brilliance was nothing short of legendary. In the group
            stage, he opened with a stunning hat-trick against PSV, reminding
            everyone that he was still the king of Europe. He continued to shine
            against Inter Milan and Tottenham. Then Leo provided 2 goals and 2
            assists against Lyon in RO16.<span class="br"></span>In the
            quarterfinals, Barcelona faced Manchester United, and Messi took
            over. After a 1-0 win at Old Trafford, he put on a clinic in the
            second leg at Camp Nou, scoring a brace, including a left-footed
            strike that slid under David de Gea. Barça advanced 4-0 on
            aggregate. Then came one of the most iconic performances of his
            Champions League career—in the semifinal first leg against
            Liverpool. With the game poised at 1-0, Messi scored twice in the
            second half, including a jaw-dropping free-kick from 35 yards out
            that flew into the top corner. The Camp Nou erupted as Messi
            celebrated his 600th goal for Barcelona in spectacular fashion. The
            3-0 win felt like a foot in the final... but what followed in the
            second leg at Anfield became one of the most painful chapters of his
            career. Barcelona lost 4-0 in a shocking collapse. Messi created
            chances, fought until the last minute, but it wasn’t enough. The
            dream slipped away, but his individual performances throughout the
            tournament were undeniable.<span class="br"></span>In La Liga, Messi
            was unstoppable. He finished the season as the league’s top scorer
            with 36 goals, claiming his sixth Pichichi Trophy. He also led the
            league in assists and created chances week after week, often
            dragging Barcelona across the finish line in tight games. Whether it
            was stunning solo goals, last-minute winners, or his signature free
            kicks, also the beautiful goal vs. Real Betis. Messi dominated the
            Spanish top flight and led Barça to yet another La Liga title.<span
              class="br"
            ></span
            >In the Copa del Rey, Barcelona reached the final after defeating
            Real Madrid at the Bernabéu in the semifinal second leg—a game where
            Messi didn’t score but dictated the rhythm and embarrassed Madrid’s
            midfield with his control. However, in the final against Valencia,
            Barcelona fell 2-1, despite Messi scoring the lone goal. It was a
            tough end to a tournament that looked promising.<span
              class="br"
            ></span>
            On the international front, Messi returned to play for Argentina in
            the 2019 Copa América. He scored against Paraguay and helped
            Argentina reach the semifinals. The run ended in controversy with a
            2-0 loss to Brazil, where Messi criticized CONMEBOL for poor
            officiating. Despite not lifting the trophy, he remained Argentina’s
            emotional leader. The 2018/19 season might be remembered by many for
            the painful night at Anfield, but Messi’s level was absolutely
            elite. He finished with 51 goals in 50 appearances. He won La Liga,
            claimed his 10th league title, top-scorer of the Champions League
            (12). From the free-kick against Liverpool, to his 600th goal, to
            another Pichichi and yet another Ballon d’Or—it was a season that
            reminded the world why Lionel Messi is simply unmatched.

            The 2019/20 season was one of the most turbulent and challenging in
            Lionel Messi’s career, both on and off the pitch. It was a year
            filled with uncertainty, frustration, and drama—but through it all,
            Messi continued to lead by example, delivering moments of brilliance
            even in the most difficult times.<span class="br"></span>In the
            Champions League, Messi stepped up during crucial matches. In the
            group stage, he dazzled in the 3-1 win over Borussia Dortmund,
            scoring a goal and providing two assists in a dominant display at
            Camp Nou. Then, in the Round of 16 against Napoli, Messi delivered
            again. In the second leg, he scored a stunning solo goal—slaloming
            past defenders and finishing from the ground—helping Barça advance
            with a 3-1 win (4-2 on aggregate). It was classic Messi, even during
            a chaotic season. However, the campaign unraveled in the
            quarterfinals with the infamous 2-8 defeat to Bayern Munich. It was
            one of the darkest nights in Barcelona’s history, and Messi’s
            frustration was visible. That loss, coupled with internal issues at
            the club, would spark massive changes.<span class="br"></span>The
            season was also heavily disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which
            paused football for months. When it returned, games were played
            behind closed doors, and the atmosphere around the team felt
            deflated. Off the pitch, tensions between Messi and the board
            escalated, and at the end of the season, he even publicly announced
            his desire to leave the club—something unthinkable at the time.<span
              class="br"
            ></span>
            Despite the chaos, Messi still finished the season with 31 goals and
            25 assists, and won the Pichichi Trophy for the fourth consecutive
            year, leading La Liga in both goals and assists.<span

            >But for Messi, it wasn’t enough—Barcelona ended the season
            trophyless for the first time since 2007/08. The 2019/20 season was
            not just about stats—it was about struggle. Messi carried a broken
            team, gave everything, and when the weight became too heavy, he made
            it clear: something had to change.
