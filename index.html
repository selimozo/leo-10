            In the 2004/05 season, Lionel Messi made his debut for FC
            Barcelona's first team, marking the beginning of an extraordinary
            career. At just 17 years old, Messi appeared in his first official
            match on October 16, 2004, against Espanyol, becoming the youngest
            player to represent Barcelona in an official competition at that
            time. He scored his first senior goal on May 1, 2005, against
            Albacete, which made him the youngest goal scorer in the club's
            history at that point. This goal, assisted by Ronaldinho, was a
            glimpse of the chemistry that would develop between the two and
            foreshadowed Messi’s future greatness. Throughout the season, Messi
            trained regularly with the first team, gaining valuable experience
            and adapting to the high level of competition in La Liga. Barcelona,
            under Frank Rijkaard, won the La Liga title that year, with Messi
            contributing to the team’s success as a promising young talent. His
            performances hinted at the exceptional player he would soon become,
            and the 2004/05 season is remembered as the start of Messi's
            legendary journey in professional football.
