            In the 2004/05 season, Lionel Messi made his debut for FC
            Barcelona's first team, marking the beginning of an extraordinary
            career. At just 17 years old, Messi appeared in his first official
            match on October 16, 2004, against Espanyol, becoming the youngest
            player to represent Barcelona in an official competition at that
            time.
            <span class="br"></span>He scored his first senior goal on May 1,
            2005, against Albacete, which made him the youngest goal scorer in
            the club's history at that point. This goal, assisted by Ronaldinho,
            was a glimpse of the chemistry that would develop between the two
            and foreshadowed Messi’s future greatness. Throughout the season,
            Messi trained regularly with the first team, gaining valuable
            experience and adapting to the high level of competition in La Liga.

            match, Messi's hat-trick making him the all-time top scorer in El
            Clásico history at that point, surpassing Alfredo Di Stéfano.
            Despite Messi's brilliance, Barcelona had a tough season, finishing
            second in La Liga, getting eliminated by Atlético Madrid in the
            Champions League quarterfinals, and losing the Copa del Rey final to
            Real Madrid. This season was marked by Messi's individual brilliance
            but also by the team's struggle to secure major trophies.<span

            the final in Brazil. Messi was instrumental throughout the
            tournament, scoring crucial goals and assists, but Argentina
            narrowly lost 1-0 to Germany in the final. Despite the defeat, Messi
            was awarded the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player.

            The 2014/15 season was a historic one for Lionel Messi and FC
            Barcelona, marked by the incredible success of the "MSN" trio—Messi,
            Luis Suárez, and Neymar—who combined to score an astonishing 122
            goals across all competitions. Messi was instrumental in leading
            Barcelona to a treble, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey, and UEFA
            Champions League. One of the most iconic moments of the season came
            in Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao. Messi scored an
            extraordinary solo goal, dribbling past several defenders from the
            right wing before finishing with a powerful strike. The commentator
            famously exclaimed, "Can he go all the way!" as Messi's brilliance
            left everyone in awe. This goal is often regarded as one of the best
            of his career.<span class="br"></span>Another unforgettable moment
            was in the Champions League semifinals against Bayern Munich. In the
            first leg at the Camp Nou, Messi scored twice, with his second goal
            becoming legendary. He dribbled past Jerome Boateng, causing the
            defender to lose his balance and fall, before calmly chipping the
            ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. This moment was widely celebrated
            and became a defining highlight of Messi’s career. In the Champions
            League, Barcelona defeated Juventus 3-1 to win the title. Messi's
            performances throughout the tournament also saw him become the joint
            top scorer of UEFA Champions League for the season. The 2014/15
            season was filled with iconic moments for Messi, from his
            partnership with Suárez and Neymar to his brilliant individual
            displays, making it one of the most memorable campaigns of his
            illustrious career.

            FC Barcelona, building on the success of their treble-winning
            campaign the previous season. Messi continued to play a central role
            in Barcelona's dominance, leading the team to several major
            victories to his already impressive collection. Messi, alongside
            Suarez and Neymar, formed the lethal "MSN" attacking trio, which
            terrorized defenses across Europe. The trio scored a combined total
            of 131 goals in all competitions, surpassing their own record from
            the previous season.<span class="br"></span>One of the standout
            moments of the season was Messi's performance in the UEFA Super Cup
            against Sevilla. Barcelona won 5-4 in a thrilling match, with Messi
            scoring two stunning free-kick goals to help secure the trophy. His
            ability to deliver in crucial moments was once again on full
            display. In La Liga, Messi was instrumental in Barcelona’s title
            defense, contributing with key goals and assists. One memorable
            moment came in a win over Celta Vigo, where Messi assisted Luis
            Suárez with an ingenious pass from a penalty kick, a move that drew
            widespread admiration for its creativity. Messi also played a
            pivotal role in Barcelona's journey to the Copa del Rey final, where
            they faced Sevilla. In a tense and hard-fought match, Barcelona
            emerged victorious with a 2-0 win after extra time, securing the
            domestic double.<span class="br"></span>Although Barcelona fell
            short in Champions League quarterfinals, Messi’s overall
            contribution to the season was immense. In addition to his club
            games, Messi also leading the national team to the Copa America
            final. Though Argentina were runners-up after losing to Chile on
            penalties, Messi was named the tournament's top assist provider.

            returned to the Camp Nou with a mountain to climb. In what is now
            remembered as "La Remontada", Messi and his teammates pulled off the
            greatest comeback in Champions League history, winning 6-1 in the
            second leg. Messi scored the third goal from the penalty spot,
            reigniting hope and belief. Neymar and Sergi Roberto finished off

            In a must-win game against Real Madrid, the score was tied 2-2
            heading into stoppage time. Then, in the 92nd minute, Messi scored a
            stunning winner, finishing off a team move with his trademark
            composure. After the goal, he held up his No. 10 shirt to the
            stunned Madrid crowd—an image that instantly became symbolic of his
            dominance. That goal wasn’t just a winner in El Clásico—it was also
            his 500th goal for Barcelona, making the moment even more
            historic.<span class="br"></span> Messi also helped Barcelona lift
            silverware that season. At the very start of the campaign, they won
            the Spanish Super Cup, defeating Sevilla 5-0 on aggregate. Messi
            scored in the second leg and was heavily involved across both
            matches. Later in the season, Barcelona claimed the Copa del Rey
            title, beating 3-1 in the final. Messi opened the scoring and

            brilliance was on full display across all competitions, as he led
            the team to a domestic double and continued to break records with
            ease. <span class="br"></span>Before the club season even began,
            Messi had already delivered one of the most iconic performances of
            his international career. In October 2017, Argentina faced Ecuador
            in their final World Cup qualifier. Argentina were at risk of
            missing the 2018 World Cup. After conceding an early goal, the
            pressure was immense. But Messi stepped up in legendary fashion,
            scoring a hat-trick to complete the comeback and secure Argentina’s
            ticket to World Cup. His second goal, a rocket into the top corner,
            and his third, a calm chip over the keeper, were reminders that
            Messi thrives in the biggest moments. That night, he didn’t just win
            a football match—he saved a nation’s World Cup hopes.<span
              class="br"
            ></span
            >At club level, Messi picked up right where he left off. One of the
            season’s standout moments came in the Champions League Round of 16
            against Chelsea. After a goalless draw in the first leg at Stamford
            Bridge, the pressure was on in the return leg at the Camp Nou. Messi
            rose to the occasion, scoring twice and assisting once, dismantling
            Chelsea almost single-handedly. His first goal came just over two
            minutes in—Barcelona’s fastest ever in a Champions League match.
            Over the two legs, he ended a long-standing drought against Chelsea
            and proved once again he was built for the biggest nights. Earlier
            in the group stage, Messi also shined against Juventus and Gianluigi
            Buffon, scoring a brilliant brace in a 3-0 win and leading Barça to
            top their group unbeaten.<span class="br"></span> On the domestic
            front, Messi was unstoppable. He finished as the top scorer in La
            Liga with 34 goals, playing a vital role in helping Barcelona go
            unbeaten for 36 games and clinch the league title with style. His
            performances in key games, including late winners, free-kick
            stunners, and brilliant assists, showcased his dominance in Spain
            yet again. FC Barcelona lost only one game in La Liga that season —
            and Messi wasn't even in the squad for that match.<span
              class="br"
            ></span
            >In the Copa del Rey, Messi was at the heart of another title run.
            In the final against Sevilla, Barcelona delivered a footballing
            exhibition, winning 5-0 in one of the most one-sided finals in
            memory. On the world stage, he also starred in the 2018 World Cup
            group stage, especially in the must-win match against Nigeria. Under
            intense pressure, Messi opened the scoring with a stunning
            goal—taking down a long ball in full stride and finishing with his
            weaker foot. It was a moment of magic that helped Argentina to
            advance.

            The 2018/19 season was a year where Lionel Messi delivered some of
            the finest football of his career. Named club captain after
            Iniesta’s departure, Messi embraced the responsibility and put
            Barcelona on his back, leading them through a season filled with
            breathtaking performances, unforgettable goals, and dominant
            displays. Although the UCL campaign ended in heartbreak, Messi’s
            individual brilliance was nothing short of legendary. In the group
            stage, he opened with a stunning hat-trick against PSV, reminding
            everyone that he was still the king of Europe. He continued to shine
            against Inter Milan and Tottenham. Then Leo provided 2 goals and 2
            assists against Lyon in RO16.<span class="br"></span>In the
            quarterfinals, Barcelona faced Manchester United, and Messi took
            over. After a 1-0 win at Old Trafford, he put on a clinic in the
            second leg at Camp Nou, scoring a brace, including a left-footed
            strike that slid under David de Gea. Barça advanced 4-0 on
            aggregate. Then came one of the most iconic performances of his
            Champions League career—in the semifinal first leg against
            Liverpool. With the game poised at 1-0, Messi scored twice in the
            second half, including a jaw-dropping free-kick from 35 yards out
            that flew into the top corner. The Camp Nou erupted as Messi
            celebrated his 600th goal for Barcelona in spectacular fashion. The
            3-0 win felt like a foot in the final... but what followed in the
            second leg at Anfield became one of the most painful chapters of his
            career. Barcelona lost 4-0 in a shocking collapse. Messi created
            chances, fought until the last minute, but it wasn’t enough. The
            dream slipped away, but his individual performances throughout the
            tournament were undeniable.<span class="br"></span>In La Liga, Messi
            was unstoppable. He finished the season as the league’s top scorer
            with 36 goals, claiming his sixth Pichichi Trophy. He also led the
            league in assists and created chances week after week, often
            dragging Barcelona across the finish line in tight games. Whether it
            was stunning solo goals, last-minute winners, or his signature free
            kicks, also the beautiful goal vs. Real Betis. Messi dominated the
            Spanish top flight and led Barça to yet another La Liga title.<span
              class="br"
            ></span
            >In the Copa del Rey, Barcelona reached the final after defeating
            Real Madrid at the Bernabéu in the semifinal second leg—a game where
            Messi didn’t score but dictated the rhythm and embarrassed Madrid’s
            midfield with his control. However, in the final against Valencia,
            Barcelona fell 2-1, despite Messi scoring the lone goal. It was a
            tough end to a tournament that looked promising.<span

            ></span>
            On the international front, Messi returned to play for Argentina in
            the 2019 Copa América. He scored against Paraguay and helped
            Argentina reach the semifinals. The run ended in controversy with a
            2-0 loss to Brazil, where Messi criticized CONMEBOL for poor
            officiating. Despite not lifting the trophy, he remained Argentina’s
            emotional leader. The 2018/19 season might be remembered by many for
            the painful night at Anfield, but Messi’s level was absolutely
            elite. He finished with 51 goals in 50 appearances. He won La Liga,
            claimed his 10th league title, top-scorer of the Champions League
            (12). From the free-kick against Liverpool, to his 600th goal, to
            another Pichichi and yet another Ballon d’Or—it was a season that
            reminded the world why Lionel Messi is simply unmatched.

            Messi continued to lead by example, delivering moments of brilliance
            even in the most difficult times.<span class="br"></span>In the
            Champions League, Messi stepped up during crucial matches. In the

            scoring a goal and providing two assists in a dominant display at
            Camp Nou. Then, in the Round of 16 against Napoli, Messi delivered
            again. In the second leg, he scored a stunning solo goal—slaloming
            past defenders and finishing from the ground—helping Barça advance
            with a 3-1 win (4-2 on aggregate). It was classic Messi, even during
            a chaotic season. However, the campaign unraveled in the
            quarterfinals with the infamous 2-8 defeat to Bayern Munich. It was
            one of the darkest nights in Barcelona’s history, and Messi’s
            frustration was visible. That loss, coupled with internal issues at
            the club, would spark massive changes.<span class="br"></span>The
            season was also heavily disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which
            paused football for months. When it returned, games were played
            behind closed doors, and the atmosphere around the team felt
            deflated. Off the pitch, tensions between Messi and the board
            escalated, and at the end of the season, he even publicly announced
            his desire to leave the club—something unthinkable at the time.<span
              class="br"
            ></span>
            Despite the chaos, Messi still finished the season with 31 goals and

            year, leading La Liga in both goals and assists.<span

            in crucial moments, and showed relentless ambition, but they
            eventually fell short. Barça finished third, and the Champions
            League dream ended early after a tough loss to PSG, despite Messi
            scoring a thunderbolt in the second leg. But Messi didn’t walk away
            empty-handed. In the Copa del Rey, he put on one of his greatest
            final performances ever. In the 4-0 win over Athletic Club, Messi
            scored twice—including a breathtaking team goal he started and
            finished—showing he still had magic in every step. He lifted the
            trophy with a smile, knowing he gave everything.<span
              class="br"
            ></span
            >And then came the farewell. Financial issues at the club meant
            Barcelona couldn’t renew his contract. In August 2021, an emotional
            Messi held a tearful press conference, announcing he was leaving the
            only club he ever knew. Fans, players, and legends around the world
            mourned the end of an unmatched legacy—over 20 years, 672 goals, 35
            trophies just for FC Barcelona.<span class="br"></span>But Messi’s
            story didn’t end in tears. That same summer, he found glory with his
            country. In the 2021 Copa América, Messi was captain, leader, and
            standout performer—scoring goals, providing assists, and inspiring
            the team. In the final against Brazil at the Maracanã, Argentina won
            1-0. As the final whistle blew, Messi collapsed to the ground in
            tears—he had finally done it. He was named Player of the Tournament.
            He was the top scorer and the top assist provider of that
            tournament. Argentina's team had come together, and their happiness
            was remarkable.<span class="br"></span>The 2020/21 season was a
            rollercoaster: one last fight with Barça, a painful goodbye, and
            then the ultimate triumph with Argentina. Messi gave everything—for
            his club, for his country, for football. And though it marked the
            end of an era in Barcelona, it also opened a new one—with Messi now
            forever complete.

          <p class="exp">
            The 2021/22 season marked a turning point in football history. After
            over two decades at FC Barcelona, Lionel Messi made the emotional
            move to Paris Saint-Germain—a shocking transfer that truly ended an
            era and began a bold new chapter. Paris buzzed with excitement. The
            city, the fans, the club—everything felt like it was holding its
            breath to witness what Messi would bring to the French capital. From
            the very start, Messi’s presence changed PSG’s energy. The locker
            room was full of superstars, but his arrival elevated the team’s
            mentality. Off the pitch, he was quickly embraced by Neymar, his
            brother in football, and their reunion brought back joy and
            chemistry from the MSN days. The two often trained side by side,
            laughing, linking up like they never spent years apart. Then came
            the fascinating partnership with Kylian Mbappé—one of the most
            explosive young players in the world. While media attention focused
            on potential tension or egos, Messi quietly let his game speak.<span
              class="br"
            ></span>
            Over time, he and Mbappé began to click, with Messi dropping deep to
            create and Mbappé darting in behind. Their combinations lit up Ligue
            1 with moments of pure brilliance. In the Champions League, Messi
            delivered one of his most iconic PSG moments against Manchester
            City. At the Parc des Princes, in front of a packed stadium, he
            scored a stunning goal to seal the victory. A quick exchange with
            Mbappé and then a left-footed rocket into the top corner—against Pep
            Guardiola, no less. It wasn’t just a goal; it was a message. Messi
            had arrived in Paris.<span class="br"></span>Another moment that
            stood out was his Ligue 1-clinching goal against Lens later in the
            season. It was a beautiful strike, a true Messi moment, helping PSG
            officially secure the French title. The stadium erupted, and though
            it wasn’t a dramatic race for the title, the celebration felt
            meaningful. It was his first league trophy outside of Spain—and a
            reminder that Messi doesn’t just show up for the big stages, he
            helps teams finish the job.<span class="br"></span>Off the pitch,
            the season was full of firsts. Sharing a dressing room with former
            rivals like Sergio Ramos was a wild twist. But even that dynamic
            turned into mutual respect. They were no longer rivals but part of a
            collective goal. Messi also grew close with Marco Verratti, whose
            technical style and football IQ meshed perfectly with Messi’s
            rhythm. Their understanding was smooth, natural, almost like they’d
            played together for years. Though it wasn’t a season defined by
            overwhelming numbers, it was about adaptation, connection, and
            evolution. Messi brought calm leadership to a star-studded dressing
            room. He helped carry the weight of expectation with humility and
            lifted the club to another level simply by being there. His name on
            the team sheet changed the way opponents played.<span
              class="br"
            ></span
            >His presence alone shifted the culture. The 2021/22 season was
            about Messi learning a new footballing language—and still finding
            ways to speak it fluently. From the magic against City, to the
            title-winning goal, to his growing bond with new teammates, Messi’s
            first season in Paris was a quiet storm—a foundation laid for
            greatness to follow.

            The 2022/23 season wasn’t just another chapter in Lionel Messi’s
            career—it was the crowning one. A year where legacy met destiny. At
            Paris Saint-Germain, Messi found his rhythm. And with Argentina, he
            fulfilled the dream that had followed him since childhood.<span
              class="br"
            ></span
            >After a year of settling in, Messi returned to PSG in 2022 with a
            different energy—sharp, focused, and fully adapted to French
            football. His movement was effortless, his connection with Mbappé
            and Neymar sharper than ever. Week after week, he became the
            heartbeat of the team—dropping deep, picking out impossible passes,
            and scoring with that familiar left foot that defenders still
            couldn’t stop. One of the season's iconic moments came in April,
            when PSG faced RC Lens. In a tight, title-defining clash, Messi
            delivered with a first-time strike after a smooth link-up with
            Mbappé—a goal that secured PSG the Ligue 1 title. The celebration
            was calm, but the message was loud: even as the world turned toward
            Qatar and Argentina, Messi was still a giant at club level. And
            earlier in the season, in the Champions League, Messi delivered a
            stunning goal against Maccabi Haifa, twisting, turning, and curling
            the ball in classic Messi fashion. It was a reminder to Europe that
            he wasn’t just preparing for the World Cup—he was still dominating
            in the biggest arenas.<span class="br"></span>But the defining story
            of 2022 was written in Qatar, in the heat of the FIFA World Cup. At
            35 years old, Messi led Argentina with the hunger of a kid and the
            calm of a king. From the first whistle, it was clear: this wasn’t
            just about football anymore—it was about legacy. After a shocking
            loss to Saudi Arabia, Messi responded like only he could. A stunning
            goal against Mexico, a masterclass vs Poland, and a breathtaking
            assist against the Netherlands in one of the tournament's most
            emotional matches. Then came the semi-final against Croatia, where
            he toyed with defenders, set up Julián Álvarez with a dazzling run,
            and once again stamped his control on the world’s stage. And
            then—the Final. Against France, in arguably the greatest World Cup
            final ever played, Messi scored twice. He led his country with poise
            through extra time and delivered again in the penalty shootout. When
            Gonzalo Montiel converted the winning penalty, Messi dropped to his
            knees. World champion. At last. He lifted the trophy in Lusail
            Stadium, draped in the bisht, smiling through tears. That
            image—Messi with the World Cup in hand—was the final piece of his
            legacy. The world agreed: The greatest of all time.<span
              class="br"
            ></span
            >Returning to PSG, Messi was greeted like royalty. Fans around the
            globe celebrated his triumph, and even rival players lined up to
            congratulate him. On the pitch, he kept delivering—leading PSG with
            elegance, creating chances out of thin air, and enjoying every
            moment in his post-World Cup glow. He ended the season by helping
            PSG retain the Ligue 1 title. And while the club fell short in the
            Champions League, Messi's impact on and off the field was
            undeniable. The football, the leadership, the joy—he played with
            freedom.<span class="br"></span>2022/23 was the season Messi
            completed football. Not just with goals or trophies—but with grace,
            fire, humility, and heart. He inspired a nation, lifted a club, and
            united fans from all over the world. From the lights of Paris to the
            desert skies of Qatar, Lionel Messi didn’t just play football—he
            authored history.

            >Let's look closer for the World Cup... Qatar 2022 wasn’t just
            another tournament—it was a stage built for Lionel Messi. At 35
            years old, in his fifth and final World Cup, the greatest player of
            all time entered with one goal: to bring glory back to Argentina, to
            finish the story, and to silence every last doubt. What followed was
            not just a triumph—it was a football fairytale.<span

            >The journey began with heartbreak. Messi opened Argentina’s
            campaign with a calm penalty against Saudi Arabia, giving them a
            lead and a sense of control. But in a stunning twist, Saudi Arabia
            struck back twice in the second half. Argentina lost. The streak was
            broken. And the dream, for a moment, looked in danger of fading
            before it even began. But in the face of panic, Messi stayed calm.
            In the press, in the locker room, his message was clear: “We will
            not let this define us.”<span class="br2"></span>...Messi’s Moment
            of Magic – Argentina 2-0 Mexico<span class="br2"></span>Argentina
            now had to win. The pressure was immense. For 64 tense minutes, the
            game was stuck in deadlock—until the ball rolled to Messi just
            outside the box. With one touch to settle it and one low strike with
            his left, he changed everything. The goal shook the stadium, the
            fans, and the tournament. It was vintage Messi: effortless,
            ruthless, divine. He wasn’t just saving Argentina. He was awakening
            them.<span class="br2"></span>...Elegance and Control – Argentina

            beautiful football against Poland. Messi was everywhere—creating,
            driving, dictating the pace. He even missed a penalty, but it didn’t
            matter. His influence on the pitch was total. Argentina advanced.

            poetic displays of his World Cup career. He scored the opening goal
            with a graceful left-footed shot that glided into the bottom
            corner—his first ever goal in a World Cup knockout match. It wasn’t
            flashy—it was timeless Messi. Precision. Calm. Beauty. In the second
            half, as Australia pushed back, Messi remained the calm in the
            chaos. Argentina survived. The legend continued.<span

            fired up—shouting, pointing, leading. But the game took a wild turn.
            The Dutch scored twice, the second in the 100th minute, forcing
            extra time. Tensions exploded. Fouls flew. Yellow cards piled up. It
            became a war. Then, penalties. As always, Messi stood tall. He
            converted the first penalty for Argentina and celebrated every
            teammate’s success with raw, unfiltered emotion. When Lautaro
            Martínez hit the winner, Messi sank to his knees. After the game,
            cameras captured him shouting to the Dutch bench: “¿Qué mirás,
            bobo?” It was the fire of a captain defending his people. Messi
