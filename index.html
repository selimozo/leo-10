            In the 2004/05 season, Lionel Messi made his official debut for FC
            Barcelona. At 17 years old, he played his first La Liga match on
            October 16, 2004, against Espanyol. Later in the season, on May 1,
            2005, Messi scored his first senior goal for the club against
            Albacete, becoming the youngest scorer in Barcelona's history at the
            time. This season marked the start of Messi's professional career.

            In the 2005/06 season, Lionel Messi became a regular part of FC
            Barcelona's first team. He played in more matches, including key
            games in La Liga and the UEFA Champions League. One notable
            performance was against Chelsea in the Champions League, where
            Messi's dribbling and pace caused problems for the English side,
            though he was unfortunately injured in the second leg. He also
            scored his first Champions League goal against Panathinaikos.
            Despite his season being cut short by injury, Messi played a role in
            Barcelona winning both La Liga and the Champions League.
